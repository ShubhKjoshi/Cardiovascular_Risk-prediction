# Cardiovascular_Risk-prediction
# Conclusion :
We've noticed that # XBG Classifier is the stand out performer among all models with an f1-score of #  0.8397. it's safe to say that XGB Classifier provides an optimal solution to our problem.

In case of Logistic regression, We were able to see the maximum f1-score of 0.658.

Out of the tree-based algorithms, the Random Forest Classifier was providing an optimal solution towards achieving our Objective. We were able to achieve an f1-score of 0.7703 We also noticed that in the case of Decision-tree Classifier, we were able to achieve an f1-score of 0.7034 for the test split.

For SVM(Support Vector Machines) Classifier, the f1-score lies around 0.7417.

Finally , As in the medical domain ( False negative values have importance we dont want to mispredict a person safe when he has the risk) recall ha the most importance..KNN, XGB , Random Forest gave the best recall 0.86 ,0.80 ,0.81.
